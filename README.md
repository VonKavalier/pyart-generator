# pyart-generator
Little script that generates canva based on provided characters

[Live demo](http://tilde.town/~von/pyart/) (regenerated every minute)

## How to use

This script works with and without parameters

### Without parameters

Launching the script without specifying anything generates a canva with a random set of predefined characters.

`$ python pyart.py`

### With parameters

You can choose which set to use by specifying its number when calling the script

`$ python pyart.py 3`

If the number is higher than the number of sets, you'll be asked to choose another

## Now what ?

Do whatever you want with that script, reuse, rewrite and so on.
You can also create new sets and make a pull request that I'll review :)
